## Why would you use Logs Filter 2 instead of CRTL+F?

It is more efficient and more readable for sizeable files. Ctrl+f is limited when you need a clear and readable output. Moreover, this project accepts multiple filters. Not everyone has knowledge in Linux/Windows terminal. The software comes with a simple interface.
