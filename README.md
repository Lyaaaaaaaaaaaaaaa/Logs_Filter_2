# Logs_Filter_2

## What does this project do?

This project is a lightweight user-friendly software which filters logs. You give him a log file and filters and it displays for you the lines where your filters appear.

**This is a re-write of my previous project** [Lyaaaaa's Logs Filter](https://github.com/Lyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/Lyaaaaa-s-Logs-Filter). This aims at being more portable, faster and easier to maintain. 

## Why is this project useful?
It is more efficient and more readable for sizeable files. Ctrl+f is limited when you need a clear and readable output. Moreover, this project accepts multiple filters. Not everyone has knowledge in Linux/Windows terminal. The software comes with a simple interface usable by anyone.
